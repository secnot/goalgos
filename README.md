# Go algorithms and Data Structures

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/secnot/goalgos.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/secnot/goalgos)


This is a compilation of classical algorithms I coded while learning Go, it 
isn't exhaustive, nor production ready. Still I hope it is useful as a learning
resource.
